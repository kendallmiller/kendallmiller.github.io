title: Effort doesn't equal Value
description: We naturally assume anything that's difficult must be worth it - but it turns out how much others value what we've accomplished is independent of how hard it was to achieve.

# It was hard but worth it!

How many times have we all said that?  It's easy to assume the more difficult something is, the more valuable it is.  We've grown up with this message - the harder the work, the sweeter the reward.  And we've experienced it in our personal lives - exercising four times a week for months to lose weight, taking ever longer hikes so we can climb the trail up a mountain, skiing for years so we can safely fly down a double diamond trail.

And we've been teaching ourselves a lie.

# Pursue Outcomes, not Methods

Let's say you want to hire someone to mow your lawn each week.  What do you value?

* **The Lawn is mowed when the grass gets long enough**: Depending on the weather, grass will grow faster or slower; you don't care about it being mowed each week as much as you want it mowed often enough that your lawn doesn't look like it needs mowing.
* **Clippings are cleaned up**: You probably want all of the grass clippings cleaned off your driveway and the sidewalk; if you're bagging the clippings you want them taken away, in short - you want your property to look tidy.
* **All the grass is cut**: Regardless of the equipment used you want to be sure it's edged and trimmed so all of the grass is cut.

For any vendor that can achieve that, there's a price you'll pay for their services - a reflection of what you really value.

Now let's say you're a vendor: You could use a set of hand sheers, a push mower, or a large commercial mower.  Your choice dramatically affects the effort that you're putting into the job.  But, the customer's _already determined the value_[^excludingLuxury].  So - regardless of the effort you put in, the value of the equation is already fixed.

# Value isn't Cost either

If you follow this train of logic to its conclusion, value isn't directly scaled by cost either.  Something cheap can be of poor value, and something expensive can be of great value.  I was lucky to start my career with John Deere when they introduced the concept of Genuine Value - that a product can still be of great value even if it was more expensive than a competitive product as long as it exceeded the customer's expectations.  The core idea is to build a product great enough to justify its price.

This thinking drives the virtuous circle that great brands understand - like Apple, John Deere, and Disney:

* If you believe you can charge more for your product because customers will value it more, you can invest more in creating the product.
* If you consistently exceed customers' expectations at a higher price point than your competitors, your customers will have faith in your brand's value when selecting a new product
* If your customers have faith in your brand's value you know you can sell products at the top of the market.

This cycle works both ways - if you start by aiming at the "cheap value" market, you'll have low margins and be known as the low-cost player.  That limits what you can invest in your products, making it very difficult to expand into new products or increase your margins. Your only path to revenue growth is volume.

There is a limit to value pricing - for a given product, above a certain point there just is no rational value play to be made.  This is the territory of luxury goods and luxury brands.  If you're in that space you'll have entirely different considerations at play.

# Aim for Genuine Value

If you're a small to medium player in your market (or a startup), I recommend focusing on creating products that fit the genuine value level: They are priced near the upper end of the competitive range but for their target audience offer a compelling value proposition that justifies the price.  For startups in particular this can help make many product decisions before launch to ensure your initial offering justifies the price you're asking.

[^excludingLuxury]: This ignores luxury goods where the whole point is the extra effort put into the production of the item, like fresh hand-made food.  Even then, do they care if you hand-sliced the lettuce or used a food processor, as long as it's fresh?
