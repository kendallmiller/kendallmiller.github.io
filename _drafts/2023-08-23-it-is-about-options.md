A frequent question I get from folks making the transition from Developer to Manager is "How do I say no?"  It's a common struggle: Someone above you in leadership comes to you with a directive to do something you think is the wrong path.  Perhaps it's taking on yet another project while your team is struggling to deliver on what you have already, or an approach to solving a problem that's going to create a lot of technical debt.

As a new manager, you probably intuit that telling leadership a simple no likely won't fly - if they've identified a problem that needs solving, they're going to keep looking for a way to solve it with escalating costs and side effects until it's resolved.  You want to be part of the solution, so how do you achieve that without rolling over and saying yes to everything?

# Refocus on the Outcome

First, I recommend having an open conversation with the leadership that's making the request to understand what they want to achieve with it - what problem it solves, and how they got to that being the right path.  Most of the time, folks ask for what they think they can get, not what they need.  With your technical background and knowledge of the existing systems in the organization, you may be able to see alternate ways to get to the outcome once you understand it.

It's critical to approach this conversation as a collaboration - you're not asking them to justify why they want what they want but to clarify what they're hoping it achieves.  If they suspect you're trying to find a path to say no it'll likely cause them to become entrenched in their proposed solution.  To help avoid this, stay away from talking about the problems with delivering what they've asked - and keep an open mind that perhaps what they're proposing actually is more important than everything else and you'll end up compromising elsewhere.

# Give Options

Once you have a clear understanding of what they're trying to achieve, give them options that can accomplish that goal that you can deliver (and meet your other commitments).  For example, it may be that you'll have to engage outside contractors to do the work at a much higher cost and somewhat longer timeframe than typical.  Or, it could be that another initiative will have to be delayed or canceled.  

A common trap I've seen managers fall into is excluding options they believe aren't palatable to the business. This is effectively what gets you to "No" - you can't see any acceptable way to do everything with the levers you have available.  To avoid this, don't limit your thinking to the constraints you generally operate within.  Any option you can come up with that is legal and achieves the outcome is valid.

For example, If the company always uses internal developers and you need more muscle, give the options that you'd have to hire several folks and defer start until they are onboard or add contractors (even if that's never been done before).  Or, it may mean discontinuing a project that is near delivery and accepting that you'll have to ramp it back up when you get back to it, taking a significant schedule hit.  

They may not accept any of your options - but if they don't that's _them_ getting to no, not you _telling_ them no.

## What if they go Somewhere Else?

In the back of every service organization's mind is "What if the business decides to go to someone else if I say no?"  It's a valid concern in the big picture: If you always say no, the business isn't going to just give up trying to deliver.  If they have access to capital then they absolutely can go outside to solve the problem.  

When your mind goes there, consider a few things.  First, you should have provided outsourcing options as part of your conversation already.  For them to not take those options but still outsource likely means either they've dramatically under scoped the problem (likely) or there's something else afoot.

# Push the Decisions to Them

In Information Technology, your goal is to make and meet commitments for the organization.  If you're in a situation where there is no "and" option - the new objectives can't be accomplished without changing your current commitments - then make it clear you'll be needing them to communicate and get buy in for changing those commitments.  It's not IT's role to tell one part of the company they won't get what had been agreed to because they were overruled by another part of the company - Instead, you want to set up the conversation and facilitate it for both parties to broker a new set of commitments that leadership agrees to.

Few folks like direct confrontation. I've seen many times when one team outside of IT evangelized why what they wanted was the most important and best course forward and convinced IT to tell another team their initiative would be delayed.  Worse, I've seen IT decide to just try to make both happen, somehow.  This approach ultimately leads to a poor reputation for IT within the organization - if you pick favorites you aren't being a trusted partner.  If you just attempt to do everything and fail then you aren't delivering.

IT does not pick winners or losers within the organization - the various business managers need your input on what the options are and then you need to deliver on what they select.  A positive outcome of this approach is once leadership throughout the company knows that you're dealing with everyone on equal terms and in the open they'll tend to skip the middleman and start negotiating directly with each other to prioritize projects and goals.  This is the ideal outcome you're working towards.
