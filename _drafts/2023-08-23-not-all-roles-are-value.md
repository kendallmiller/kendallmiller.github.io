# Trap: make sure your whole team feels valued

A real challenge I've run into with tech teams is making sure folks that spend their day doing activities that are not directly value-generating don't feel that the organization is devaluing their efforts.  I've had QA teams absolutely up in arms at the idea they're a waste to the organization.  It's a tricky conversation to navigate - to on one hand align your team to get the most out of Lean without devaluing the efforts of part of the team.  

I've found success by making sure the team leadership conversations continue to affirm why those roles exist - focusing on the greater waste that the team is avoiding by taking on the activities.  For example, communicating how a great QA team enables you to deliver faster because you can be confident you aren't creating a problem with what you're shipping.  At the same point, it can also help the team justify why to invest in test automation or other process changes.  When team members don't think their work is important or valued by the organization, it's worth pursuing to get to the underlying believe that is driving that fear.
