I've walked in to challenging situations with teams many times in my career.  Each time, leadership knows there's an issue with our team making & meeting commitments but they're not sure what exactly to do - other than pull the levers they have of leadership, budget, and goals.  I've generally got a short period if time to earn the team's trust, show genuine progress, and figure out what the team needs to right the ship long term.

A first step I do is understand what's blocking the team from success:

* **Overcommitted**: The team appears to not have enough resources to achieve their commitments.
* **Paralyzed**: The team has resources, but can't seem to make enough progress on their commitments.
* **Scrambled**: The team has resources, but the commitments are shifting too fast to be achieved.

Each aspect tends to be present to some degree, but usually one is dominant.  Knowing which is the main challenge is essential to selecting the strategy to use first.  My goal is always to get to a team running with clear commitments, adequately resourced and with a clear mandate to achieve their commitments but to get there we have to show the business we can be trusted and we have to give the team breathing room to decompress and embrace change.

# Overcommitted Teams

It often seems like a team is overcommitted because of the basic assumption that you can get out of any problem by increasing capacity, so there must not be enough capacity to meet the needs.  In my experience it's the least likely of the three in practice.  If the problem is overcommitment then the team will be steadily delivering and the goals will be consistent but the progress isn't sufficient to meet the competitive needs of the business.

# Paralyzed Teams

I usually see this in larger organizations. The team has enough resources and has clear goals, but can't achieve them.  The team often perceives their lack of progress as being due to the context they're working in - they aren't allowed to make the necessary decisions, can't get timely support from the organization, etc.  

For these teams, my first goal is to show the team and the company they can ship.  We have to break the team free of the story they can't get things done.  

## Make, and Meet, an Unreasonable Goal

The basic technique is to identify an important change that matters to the organization, has been known by the team for a while, and hasn't been done.  Ideally it's a change that the team would _like_ to achieve it but has felt they couldn't - perhaps for organizational reasons or standards & practices.  Package up the change into a goal with a timeline that seems just workable (but it has to be close in - four to six weeks on the outside).  If you don't think it can be done in that timeframe, pick another change because the overarching objective is to demonstrate you can ship things.

As work progresses, be unyielding on the schedule.  The organization (both within the team and without) will come back with a host of objections about why the change can't be made or can't be accomplished in the timeframe.  At each turn, communicate that you hear the problem being raised but make it clear it has to be resolved and the clock is running.  This will be very uncomfortable at first - for you, for the team, and for the organization.  By holding firm on the schedule you're creating a crucible where the team will shift from focusing on why something can't be done to figuring out how it _can_ be.  

There is a bit of an art form to this - you will likely have to bend on the schedule (a bit) and the definition of success for the change (a bit).  As long as the team is making genuine progress and accelerating that's OK.  The approach is based on the assumption that a paralyzed team is unable to make progress because they either can't get out of their own way (for example, stuck on a way of solving problems that just can't scale to meet the current needs) or the organization is blocking them.  Creating the crucible of time and holding the organization and the team to it will show the latent talent you're working with that it's a new day and you are going to get things done.  Great people want to deliver, so building a relationship for delivery is a strong magnet for them.

I have to admit - I've been on the other side of this one a few times, and I've never liked it.  But, I've seen it be amazingly effective at breaking organizational paralysis.  It is a high risk strategy - you have to be sure the goal is achievable (or at least close) and if the problem isn't paralysis this can be catastrophic to the team.  If the problem is the team is overcommitted or scrambled this strategy will never work and will encourage the best folks in your team to leave, not stay.

# Scrambled Teams

I see this in smaller organizations, particularly startups as they get into growth mode.  This often happens when the team was originally just overcommitted but as the number of unmet needs has grown, the business has reacted by rapidly re-prioritizing work or slicing work up into more, smaller, temporary fixes.
