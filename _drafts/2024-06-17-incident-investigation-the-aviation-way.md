The key components of an incident review are:

1. Statement of Facts: What exactly happened, when, by whom without commentary or opinion.
2. Analysis: Reviewing the facts to assess how the processes and systems performed through the incident.
3. Issues: The problems identified during analysis.
4. Recommendations: Specific changes to processes and systems the team is recommending to leadership.

# Establish the Facts

As early as feasible during an incident, take steps to ensure you're capturing events dispassionately and accurately.  This is usually best done with someone not directly involved in the incident, but with access to the people involved.  Leadership should request folks keep contemporaneous notes as they go as well to provide once the incident has been resolved.  It's important to emphasize that this is not about blame or shame, it's to establish a baseline of facts so we can all learn.

It takes practice to faithfully capture what happened without judgement - we're used to combining the two as a shorthand to speed communication.  It's worth practicing this discussion ahead of time as part of establishing a no-blame culture.  For example:

| Instead Of   | Use This   |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| The operator was careless and selected the wrong version | The wrong version was selected |
| Bob failed to check the application was available on the new cluster before cutting over | Bob did not check the availability of the application on the new cluster before cutting over |
| Ted didn't allow enough time for load to transfer | There was insufficient time for load to transfer |

The key is to remove words that draw conclusions or convey intent.  Instead, the focus should stay on events and actions.  When complete, it should be a dry and dispassionate statement of what was so.

# Assessment

Depending on the scope of the incident, a small team qualified to understand the facts should conduct the review with the goal of arriving at a consensus analysis.  The analysis goes beyond just cause & effect - it's essential to consider:

* Qualifications: To what degree where the people involved adequately trained nad experienced for the roles they were being asked to perform?
* Context of Actions: What else was happening when the events of the incident were taking place, and how could they have affected the decisions that took place?
* What Worked: Even in the worst incident, many things worked well - an equally valuable lesson.
