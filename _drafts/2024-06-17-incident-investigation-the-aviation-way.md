The world of commercial aviation is unique - it has a hard-earned reputation for extraordinary safety. This isn't a marketing phrase or hyperbole; it comes from a relentless application of continuous improvement.  You may be thinking "Ah, Continuous improvement - like practiced by Toyota to build cars" but this is a different level.  What sets Aviation apart is the application of a no-blame incident review process over decades to refine equipment, processes - and mindsets.  It's a well proven path to long-term success - that you can leverage for your organization.  It all starts with the Incident Review.

The key components of an incident review are:

1. **Statement of Facts**: What exactly happened, when, by whom without commentary or opinion.
2. **Analysis**: Reviewing the facts to assess how the processes and systems performed through the incident.
3. **Issues**: The problems identified during analysis.
4. **Recommendations**: Specific changes to processes and systems the team is recommending to leadership.

# Iterative Process

While the stages of the incident review do need to happen in order, research has shown you should execute the first three concurrently with information and feedback flowing from stage to stage.  Facts lead to analysis lead to issues which lead back to gathering more facts.

For example, once you have a basic understanding of the facts it's worth analyzing what's known to both identify initial issues as well as realizing what's missing in the facts that needs to be augmented.

It's worth holding back on specific recommendations until the iterative process has run long enough that new facts aren't coming to light and the set of issues has largely stabilized.  Action-oriented teams will want to jump to recommendations virtually immediately which leads to solution bias and will tend to narrow the team's focus.

# Establish the Facts

As early as feasible during an incident, take steps to ensure you're capturing events dispassionately and accurately.  This is usually best done with someone not directly involved in the incident, but with access to the people involved.  Leadership should request folks keep contemporaneous notes as they go as well to provide once the incident has been resolved.  It's important to emphasize that this is not about blame or shame, it's to establish a baseline of facts so we can all learn.

It takes practice to faithfully capture what happened without judgement - we're used to combining the two as a shorthand to speed communication.  It's worth practicing this discussion ahead of time as part of establishing a no-blame culture.  For example:

| Instead Of   | Use This   |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| The operator was careless and selected the wrong version | The wrong version was selected |
| Bob failed to check the application was available on the new cluster before cutting over | Bob did not check the availability of the application on the new cluster before cutting over |
| Ted didn't allow enough time for load to transfer | There was insufficient time for load to transfer |

The key is to remove words that draw conclusions or convey intent.  Instead, the focus should stay on events and actions.  When complete, it should be a dry and dispassionate statement of what was so.

# Assessment

Depending on the scope of the incident, a small team qualified to understand the facts should conduct the review with the goal of arriving at a consensus analysis.  The analysis goes beyond just cause & effect - it's essential to consider:

* **Qualifications**: To what degree where the people involved adequately trained nad experienced for the roles they were being asked to perform?
* **Context of Actions**: What else was happening when the events of the incident were taking place, and how could they have affected the decisions that took place?
* **What Worked**: Even in the worst incident, many things worked well - an equally valuable lesson.

## Practicing the Five Whys

A powerful tactic for digging through surface observations to useful insights about root causes is the Five Whys.  Simply put, the Five Whys is done by repeatedly asking the question "Why?" with each answer forms the basis of the next "Why?" question.

(insert example of five whys)

To get the most out of your assessment, do multiple passes of this approach, branching from the first Why with the top few causes - creating a tree of factors.  Seeing the multiple paths that all cane together to create the incident can reveal the most effective remedies you can introduce that cover multiple failure paths.
