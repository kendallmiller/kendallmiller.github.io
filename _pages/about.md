# I Build SaaS Products

I've led teams creating B2B SaaS solutions for over 20 years both in startups and established organizations looking to reignite growth.  I've spent years working across all the roles in successful product companies, building the wisdom to guide teams ranging from go-to-market strategy to detailed product implementation.  My experience helps me give confidence to investors, customers, and team members that we can - and will - compete and win in the market.  

# I'm a Catalyst for Change

When I join an organization - as a contractor or employee - I work with the existing team to rapidly make a difference for them, their customers, and their stakeholders.  I'm used to getting thrown in the deep end and having to make a positive impact fast.  My experience in a range of hard technology, product, and personnel problems has given me a large toolset to draw on to help teams get the most out of what they have.

To have the biggest impact, I focus on maximizing the results the current team can produce driving in the direction of the change the organization needs to make.  I work with each team member to introduce change at a measured pace and eliminate the obstacles they identify to getting things done.  

# I Stand for Quality for the Customer

I'm relentless about delivering a premium experience for our customers - in our products and every other touch point between our customers and us.  When I started my career at John Deere, they invested heavily in teaching me that positive reputations take a long time to build and a short time to destroy.  We were not going to let down the generations that came before us by sacrificing the timeless quality Deere stands for pursuing a short-term advantage.

A quality experience goes beyond the product - it's every interaction.  I'm experienced at guiding marketing, customer service, and product teams to ensure we hit all of the marks to convert users to customers for life.
