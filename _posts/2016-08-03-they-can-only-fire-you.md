When I was younger I got really worked up as the politics and stress ramped up in my job.  An older, wiser coworker
said to me 

> Kendall - Calm down. They can only fire you.

I panicked - They could fire me?  I've never been fired from anything and that seemed like just about the worst thing that could happen.
She continued..

> They can't kill you, they can't take away your family - they can only fire you. And you'll be fine.

She was right.  I'm used to going all in on the projects I'm engaged in and it's easy to overstate
how important the drama is of whatever's going on around us.
