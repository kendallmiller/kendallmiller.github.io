When I was younger I got really worked up as the politics and stress ramped up in my job.  An older, wiser coworker
said to me 

> Kendall - Calm down. They can only fire you.

I panicked - I've never been fired from anything and that seemed like just about the worst thing that could happen.
She continued..

> They can't kill you, they can't take away your family - they can only fire you. And you'll be fine.
