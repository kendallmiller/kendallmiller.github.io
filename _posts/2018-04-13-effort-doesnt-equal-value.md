title: Effort doesn't equal Value
description: We naturally assume anything that's difficult must be worth it - but it turns out how much others value what we've accomplished is independent of how hard it was to achieve.

# It was hard, but worth it!

How many times have we all said that?  It's easy to assume the more difficult something is, the more valuable it is.
We've grown up with this message - the harder the work, the sweeter the reward.  And we've experienced it in our
personal lives - exercising four times a week for months to lose weight, taking ever longer hikes so we can climb
the trail up a mountain, skiing for years so we can safely fly down a double diamond trail.

And we've been teaching ourselves a lie.
