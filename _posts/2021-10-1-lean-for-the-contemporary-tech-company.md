Introduced and codified by Eliyahu Goldratt in [The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement](https://a.co/d/5S873wu)
in 1984, Lean Manufacturing and the Lean / Six Sigma movements it inspired were created for a different era -
before the Internet was ubiquitous and software took over the world.  It's easy to dismiss them as ancient
thinking, particularly in technology companies where the shelf life of our toolsets is measured in months, not decades.

I first was introduced to Lean / Six Sigma in the 1990s while working at John Deere.  Deere was working on
a corporate-wide adoption and seeing the practices it advocates could be applied not just in the manufacturing
parts of the company but corporate management and Information Technology (where I worked) as well.

Two decades later while working through how to address some company-wide challenges I read 
[The Phoenix Project](https://a.co/d/5ZsSk8o).  _The Phoenix Project_ attempts to retell nearly the same story 
as _The Goal_, just written from the standpoint of a team producing business-critical software, not business-critical 
parts manufacturing.  It's a good read - but if you want to broadly adopt it I'd recommend reading _The Goal_ to 
ensure you understand the core of why Lean works and how to adopt it in your company.

# Focusing on Reducing Latency

The critical common thread I've seen in successful Lean adoption has been a focus on reducing cycle time.



## Example: Government Contracts 

One company I worked with sold primarily to government customers under subscription or usage based contracts.  Government customers are notorious
for being slow to finalize contracts, sign off on systems, and ultimately go live.  But, since the contracts had 
long terms typically dating from the go-live point this wasn't often seen as an issue because our company would
get the same revenue _eventually_.  It wasn't perceived there was much advantage to pushing down the latency
at each stage to get the money sooner as the total contract value was locked and it could jeopardize our relationship
with our government customer.  Our Private Equity ownership had extensive government experience and was used to the
routine delays associated with government contracts and didn't push us to speed things up either.

I went back to the leadership team and posed the question - what if we could cut in half the time from RFP acceptance
to go live?  What would it do to our finances?  As the team laid it out quarter-by-quarter it became clear that
pulling forward the revenue would substantially help us meet our corporate goals (namely EBITDA) and likely for
little additional cost if at all.  We charged fixed fees for implementation, typically based on the first year's projected
transaction or subscription revenue so reducing our effort hours didn't hurt our revenue.  Better yet, because much of our 
effort hours were associated with periodic meetings that went on from signing until Go-Live shortening the duration would
reduce our costs.

In short, we could improve EBITDA and open up more capacity (critical in a smaller company) by doing everything we could
to drive our customer to go live faster.

If you want to put lean thinking into practice in your day-to-day technical work, [The DevOps Handbook](https://a.co/d/9lBeOaZ)
is a great way to start.  It's important to not blindly adopt any particular practice from it but read through
the goals and tradeoffs and use it for ideas on what can help and why.
