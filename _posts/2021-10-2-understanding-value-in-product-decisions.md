# Focus product decisions on clear customer value

When your team is working out new functionality, keep asking how customers will value the proposed feature. Even when you intuitively know it's a good idea, doing the work to define customer value will help the team decide how deep to go, who to validate their thinking with, and how to communicate the feature when it ships.  

To deliver value, you need to know:

* What customer need are we addressing or improving on?
* What type of customer would benefit?

The critical goal is to understand who, outside of the development team, would immediately benefit and how. Your team probably has an idea for how a change benefits users, so expand on that, being as specific as you can about the type of customer helped and how much they are helped.  

Initially, your team may struggle with this but if your instincts are it's worth building then keep turning the problem around until you can figure it out.  As a start, ask:

* What change would our customers see from this work?  If they can't see anything, it's waste.
* Once delivered, can customers do things they couldn't do before?
* Does this save customers time, in a time-critical point?


## Pitfalls in Value

Watch out for a few common problems that may prevent your customers from getting the benefit of your improvements, like:

* **Will customers use your product to solve the problem?**  A drinks fridge is a great feature, but would you pay more for a computer with one built in?  If customers won't use you to solve the problem, it's nearly the same as if you didn't solve the problem in the first place.
* **Does the new change duplicate an existing solution?** If your system already solves the problem it's usually a better investment to work out why this solution isn't sufficient.  Perhaps it's hard to use, hard to find, or too time-consuming.
* **Is the benefit deferred to the future?** When teams talk about doing work to make it easier to ship features later or faster, that's not a benefit to the customer _now_.
