This article is part of a series on [Lean for the Contemporary Tech Company](lean-for-the-contemporary-tech-company).

One of the core principles of Lean is to minimize waste.  In the context of Lean, waste has a very broad definition - any activity that does not deliver value to someone outside the organization.  Lean recognizes that your team is going to have waste in its activities; the intent is to recognize it and actively work to minimize the amount of time and effort you invest in it.

# What is waste in your SaaS?

I find technology teams struggle to recognize where the waste is in their process.  Teams can quickly point to waste like:

* Redoing a feature because the requirements were off.
* Time spent in meetings doing project planning and estimation.

Where it gets trickier is recognizing that work done because it'd be worse if we didn't do it can still be waste. A good mental check is:

>Will my customer pay more for our product because we do this?  Will they pick us over a competitor?

When you look at it that way, more waste emerges:

* **Testing & Validation Work**: Including unit tests, integration tests, manual tests, etc.
* **UI Mockups & Wireframes**: Those beautiful drawings the UX team makes for the developers to implement.
* **Patching & Upgrading Infrastructure**: Everything it takes to host your SaaS.

Each of these things may be very useful and very dear to your team, but your customer won't pick you or pay more for them: They assume you make software that works, they don't see or interact with your mockups, and they expect you to operate your system reliably and securely.   That's all table stakes.

# How to minimize Waste, deliver more, and delight your customers



# Trap: make sure your whole team feels valued

A real challenge I've run into with tech teams is making sure folks that spend their day doing activities that are not directly value generating don't feel that the organization is devaluing their efforts.  I've had QA teams absolutely up in arms at the idea they're a waste to the organization.  It's a tricky conversation to navigate - to on one hand align your team to get the most out of Lean without devaluing the efforts of part of the team.  

I've found success by making sure the team leadership conversations continue to affirm why those roles exist - focusing on the greater waste that the team is avoiding by taking on the activities.  For example, communicating how a great QA team enables you to deliver faster because you can be confident you aren't creating a problem with what you're shipping.  At the same point, it can also help the team justify why to invest in test automation or other process changes.  When team members don't think their work is important or valued by the organization, it's worth pursuing to get to the underlying believe that is driving that fear.
