# Focusing on Reducing Latency

The critical common thread I've seen in successful Lean adoption has been a focus on reducing cycle time. In manufacturing the value of this is nearly self-evident: the faster you go from order to shipped, the faster you get revenue and the more revenue you can generate per month.  In tech, the gains can be softer to see because we're selling goods we don't have to build per-customer.  

I've seen two major areas where focusing on _delivering value to the customer faster_ has paid off for our business:

1. **Find Product / Market Fit Faster**: Smart teams come up with great ideas, but customer needs are nuanced and complex so the sooner real customers use your product the earlier you can incorporate their feedback - and the less it'll cost to capitalize on the opportunities they reveal.
2. **Pull Forward Future Revenue**: The sooner a customer goes live with your system, the sooner they commit to it (and you don't lose them to inertia, inaction, or a competitor).  The sooner they commit, the sooner they may buy up to a higher tier.  The sooner they're happy and successful the sooner your team can move on to focus on the next prospective customer.

## Example: Monitoring for when things Don't go Wrong

When adding the [Monitor module](https://onloupe.com/products/monitor/) to Loupe we were very focused on the needs of Operations teams, in contrast to our initial focus on the "Dev" side of DevOps.  Our product team did all the right things to figure out what we should be building, for whom, and the difference it would make.  Our first version of the new functionality did a great job of highlighting application problems and providing the right information to fix them quickly.  It built on our existing functionality so our current customer base could easily adopt it and bring a whole new aspect of their organization into the fold.

In our first demo of the completed system to a _new_ customer, they asked "OK, so how do I know that everything's running right? I mean, what if I just deployed an app, how do I know it's working?" As we kept talking with the customer, it was clear we missed a key point: absense of an alert only means the system isn't _reporting_ a problem.  For our customer to rest easy they need to be sure they're receiving requests, processing traffic - whatever their system is designed to do.  That's what they want to purchase: A system that gives them confidence they can sign off and go about their lives.

We'd had a lot of customer conversations - but those were with customers that already had bought into our vision of the product.  With our focus on the tactics of application monitoring, we'd not gone far enough back in the value stream to understand what human needs would motivate our customers to implement (and purchase) a product like ours.

Once we implemented clear views to communicate when _no news is good news_ we started getting customers that bought us just for our Monitoring capabilities.  If we'd done a shallower initial implementation and gotten it in the hands of customers earlier we'd have brought forward a lot of revenue.

## Example: Government Contracts 

One company I worked with sold primarily to government customers under subscription or usage-based contracts.  Government customers are notorious for being slow to finalize contracts, sign off on systems, and ultimately go live.  But, since the contracts had long terms typically dating from the go-live point this wasn't often seen as an issue because our company would get the same revenue _eventually_.  It wasn't perceived there was much advantage to pushing down the latency at each stage to get the money sooner as the total contract value was locked and it could jeopardize our relationship with our government customer.  Our Private Equity ownership had extensive government experience and was used to the routine delays associated with government contracts and didn't push us to speed things up either.

I went back to the leadership team and posed the question - what if we could cut in half the time from RFP acceptance to go live?  What would it do to our finances?  As the team laid it out quarter-by-quarter it became clear that pulling forward the revenue would substantially help us meet our corporate goals (namely EBITDA) and likely for little if any additional cost.  We charged fixed fees for implementation, typically based on the first year's projected transaction or subscription revenue so reducing our effort hours didn't hurt our revenue.  Better yet, because much of our effort hours were associated with periodic meetings that went on from signing until Go-Live shortening the duration would reduce our costs.

In short, we could improve EBITDA and open up more capacity (critical in a smaller company) by doing everything we could to drive our customer to go live faster.

If you want to put lean thinking into practice in your day-to-day technical work, [The DevOps Handbook](https://a.co/d/9lBeOaZ) is a great way to start.  It's important to not blindly adopt any particular practice from it but read through the goals and tradeoffs and use it for ideas on what can help and why.
