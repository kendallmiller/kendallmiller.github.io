title: Effort doesn't equal Value
description: We naturally assume anything that's difficult must be worth it - but it turns out how much others value what we've accomplished is independent of how hard it was to achieve.

# It was hard but worth it!

How many times have we all said that?  It's easy to assume the more difficult something is, the more valuable it is.  We've grown up with this message - the harder the work, the sweeter the reward.  And we've experienced it in our personal lives - exercising four times a week for months to lose weight, taking ever longer hikes so we can climb the trail up a mountain, skiing for years so we can safely fly down a double diamond trail.

And we've been teaching ourselves a lie.

# Pursue Outcomes, not Methods

Let's say you want to hire someone to mow your lawn each week.  What do you value?

* **The Lawn is mowed when the grass gets long enough**: Depending on the weather, grass will grow faster or slower; you don't care about it being mowed each week as much as you want it mowed often enough that your lawn doesn't look like it needs mowing.
* **Clippings are cleaned up**: You probably want all of the grass clippings cleaned off your driveway and the sidewalk; if you're bagging the clippings you want them taken away, in short - you want your property to look tidy.
* **All the grass is cut**: Regardless of the equipment used you want to be sure it's edged and trimmed so all of the grass is cut.

For any vendor that can achieve that, there's a price you'll pay for their services - a reflection of the value you place on the outcome.

Now let's say you're a vendor: You could use a set of hand sheers, a push mower, or a large commercial mower.  Your choice dramatically affects the effort that you're putting into the job.  But, the customer's _already determined the value_[^excludingLuxury].  So - regardless of the effort you put in, the value of the equation is already fixed.

# Value isn't Cost either

If you follow this train of logic to its conclusion, value isn't directly scaled by cost either.  Something cheap can be of poor value, and something expensive can be of great value.  I was lucky to start my career with John Deere, a company with a long term focus on building better products at the top of the market.  Deere taught me that a product can be a better value than a competitive product even if it's more expensive - as long as it exceeds the customer's expectations.  The core idea is to build a product great enough to justify its price.

The focus on Premium Value drives a virtuous circle that great brands understand - like Apple, John Deere, and Disney:

* If you believe you can charge more for your product because customers will value it more, you can invest more in creating the product.
* If you consistently exceed customers' expectations at a higher price point than your competitors, your customers will have faith in your brand's value when selecting a new product
* If your customers have faith in your brand's value you know you can sell products at the top of the market.

This cycle works both ways - if you start by aiming at the _Cheap Value_ market, you'll have low margins and be known as the low-cost player.  That limits what you can invest in your products, making it very difficult to expand into new products or increase your margins. Your only path to revenue growth is volume.

There is a limit to value - for a given product, above a certain point there just is no rational value play to be made.  This is the territory of luxury goods and luxury brands.  If you're in that space you'll have entirely different pricing considerations.

# Aim for Premium Value

In any market there are three main value bands:

* **Cheap Value**: The product is a good value because it offers more for less money.
* **Mainstream**: The product is competitively priced in the typical range expected for the market.
* **Premium Value**: The product is a good value because it's built to a higher standard.  It costs more than is typical, but it delivers more.

If you're a small to medium player in your market (or a startup), I recommend focusing on creating products that focus on the Premium Value band: They are priced near the upper end of the competitive range but for their target audience offer a compelling value proposition that justifies the price.  For startups in particular this can help make many product decisions before launch to ensure your initial offering justifies the price you're asking.

Targeting the Premium Value market may feel daunting - it raises the bar for your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and can seem unobtainable.  But, let's run through the alternatives:

* If you target Cheap Value, all someone else has to do is match your price and they've nullified your advantage.  The established players can _easily_ do this - they've already made the big investments to get to market and they know their actual costs of operation, you're guessing.
* If you target the mainstream you're going to have a challenge differentiating your product from the other mainstream products.  Your sales team will want to lower price to stimulate sales and before you know it, you're a Cheap product.
* With Premium Value, you've got to offer a higher spec product for at least part of the market.  This is a playbook that has a track record of success - niches are often small enough not to warrant the big player's attention and will prioritize a narrow need and pay more for a product that satisfies it.
