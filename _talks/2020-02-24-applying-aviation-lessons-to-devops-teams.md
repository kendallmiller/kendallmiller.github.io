# Fly the Enterprise

Commercial Aviation is an amazingly safe mode of transportation with around 50,000 flights each day moving 3 million 
passengers in the US alone. This modern marvel works through layers of procedures carefully honed over decades of 
experience. Each time something goes wrong in aviation it is carefully dissected for anything it can teach the industry 
about performing better, safer, and more reliably.

Many of the hard-won lessons from aviation can be leveraged to build a DevOps team that can routinely take on serious 
challenges and land the plane every time. In this talk, weâ€™ll cover several key concepts from aviation operations, the 
interesting stories behind them, and how to apply them within your organization.
