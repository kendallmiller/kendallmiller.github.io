Identified product niche within the APM space and created minimum viable product.  Once established, I led the team iterating in the market to refine a developer-oriented product over 10 years and five major releases. Directed subject matter experts to create long-tail content to drive interest, introduce marketing automation to drive customer conversion, and outside UX teams to upgrade and refine the UI based on customer feedback.

* Introduced a centralized logging platform for .NET applications in 2010.
* Added Software-as-a-Service option in 2012.
* Upgraded to multi-region, Azure-native solution in 2014 sustaining 10TB/Day of data ingestion.
