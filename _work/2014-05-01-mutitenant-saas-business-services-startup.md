Led the team of developers, designers, business analysts, and marketing specialists to help an existing legal services company rebuild as a cloud-hosted startup.  Created a resellable platform for providing Registered Agency services to the original company's clients as well as other smaller Registered Agents to enable them to compete with the dominant industry players.

* **Industry-leading Audit & Traceability**: Platform was built around a versioned data strategy where the state of every record over time is tracked and related back to the specific business transaction that established it, enabling easy tracing from any state back to the organization and user that requested it and approved it.
* **Low Operating Costs**: Optimized for hosting in Microsoft Azure using all Platform-as-a-Service capabilities so costs scaled with customer growth.
* **Integrated with External Services for Business Operations**: Designed the platform to be event driven and easy to integrate with external services for marketing automation, accounting, and other operations tasks.
