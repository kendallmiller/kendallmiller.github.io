# Create an Event-driven Enterprise

My client needed to create a modern, event driven enterprise while preserving their extensive investment in their current ERP system which was running at capacity.  The goal was to enable modern applications to leverage customer event data from the ERP securely on a global scale.  This had to be accomplished with minimum additional load on the central ERP.

I lead the team to rapidly prototype and then construct a system that used native capabilities of the core database technology of the ERP from a mirror to create a real-time series of events for every customer transaction and publish those events to a wide range of subscribers within the enterprise.  Along the way, we asssited the ERP hosting team with diagnosing the root cause of performance issues they had been experiencing and identified lasting, affordable solutions.

Our final solution enabled each division access to the data for their customers, hosted on their preferred platform (both self-hosted and cloud-hosted services), without creating inter-service dependencies that would slow innovation.

# Enabling Best-fit Decisions across the Enterprise

The solution significantly reduced the barriers to adopting external SaaS products for specialized needs, enabling each business unit to select different marketing, sales, fulfillment, and commnication tools to best fit their purposes.  This in turn let the organization de-emphasize more expensive, centralized technology decisions (that required adopting a single solution that could meet every units needs), lowering overall enterprise cost and making it easier to make cost/benefit decisions within each business unit.
