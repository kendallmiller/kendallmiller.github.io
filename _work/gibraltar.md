I partnered with a trusted consultant I had worked with on previous engagements to create a new software consultancy (Gibraltar Software) focused on solving difficult application problems for customers, typically in performance-critical aspects of their platforms.  

As we took on projects, we recognized the repeating needs of our customers and created [Loupe (Click to read more about this project)](/work/loupe), an application monitoring product for .NET applications, that we used during engagements to gather key real-world data necessary to diagnose and solve problems.

During my 11 years with Gibraltar Software, I led the team to identify and execute a product acquisition, [VistaDB](https://vistadb.com), and grew our team from two people in a self-funded startup to a peak of 15 full-time and 5 contractors in three countries serving clients worldwide.  I exited my daily role with Gibraltar Software in 2021 by selling our consulting organization (including myself) to our largest customer.
